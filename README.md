# Ethereum Data Collection and Analytics Bounty


In this bounty, I collected interesting datasets using Forta, Dune Analytics, etc. Datasets include on assets, addresses, contracts, and transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Data collection was focused in 3 areas: security, compliance, and authenticity.

# Data Analytics
Ethereum Transaction data obtained from Kaggle was then analysed using libraries like Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib and Seaborn using Jupyter Notebook.
